# AsciiWebcam
This code takes advantage of the pyvirtualwebcam library in Python to convert an image from an image format to Ascii text to then work with a webcam.

# Necessary installs
To use this software you will need to install

1. OBS studio
2. pyvirtualcam
3. opencv-python
4. Pillow
5. numpy

This code is only necessary to run from terminal by just running "python main.py" in terminal of the folder. 

# Disclaimer 
this only works for Windows currently as software for Mac/Linux would prove to be more difficult to include.

This is just a prototype to a maybe future final design the current version comes with a little lag
